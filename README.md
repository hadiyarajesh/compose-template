# Compose Template

This template repository provides a quick start for creating new Android apps using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) as the UI framework, following [MVVM architecture pattern](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

It includes the following popular libraries:

- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.

- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - Image loading for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Flower](https://github.com/hadiyarajesh/flower) - Flower simplifies networking and database caching on Android/Multiplatform.

To use this template, simply click on the **Use this template** button at the top (or fork the repository) and start building your app on top of it. 
Make sure to update the package name and other app-specific details before building and deploying your app.
